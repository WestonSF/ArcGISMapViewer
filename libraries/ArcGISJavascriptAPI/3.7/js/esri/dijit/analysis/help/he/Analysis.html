            <p>Areas that overlap or share a common boundary are merged together to form a single area.    
            </p>
            <p>You can control which boundaries are merged by specifying a field. For example, if you have a layer of counties, and each county has a 
                <i>State_Name</i> attribute, you can dissolve boundaries using the
                <i>State_Name</i> attribute.  Adjacent counties will be merged together if they have the same value for
                <i>State_Name</i>.  The end result is a layer of state boundaries.

            <p>Overlay combines two or more layers into one single layer.  You can think of overlay as peering through a stack of maps and creating a single map containing all the information found in the stack,    for example:
                <ul>
                    <li>What parcels are within the 100-year floodplain? (Within is just another way of saying on top of.)
                          
                    </li>
                    <li>What roads are within what counties?
                    </li>
                    <li>What land use is on top of what soil type?
                         
                    </li>
                    <li>What wells are within abandoned military bases?
                    </li>
                </ul>
